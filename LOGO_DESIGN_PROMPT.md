## Design Requirements

3. **Growth & Faith:** Elements suggesting growth (plant, tree, roots) or spiritual ascent
4. **Bible/Word Focus:** Subtle reference to Bible pages, open book, or scripture without being literal
5. **Modern Cross Integration:** Contemporary interpretation of cross symbol (geometric, minimal, integrated)
